The resulted system should have the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Decentralization.} The system should be decentralized.
    \item \textbf{Interoperability.} The system should be able to support a large number of heterogeneous blockchains.
    \item \textbf{Openness.} The system should allow anyone to participate in consensus permissionlessly.
    \item \textbf{Consensus Scalability.} The system should be able to operate normally while maintaining sufficiently large consensus groups.
    \item \textbf{Operational Scalability.} The system should scale linearly relating to the number of supported blockchains.
    \item \textbf{Security.} The system should be able to withstand Sybil attacks.
    \item \textbf{Sustainability.} The system should be able to tolerate faults of the connected blockchains.
    \item \textbf{Upgradability.} The system should allow adding new chains over time.
\end{enumerate}
